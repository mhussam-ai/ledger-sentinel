"""Application settings — *operational* configuration only.

By design this file holds **no model decisions**. Which provider, which API key,
and which model are chosen entirely from the dashboard at runtime (see
`runtime.py`), never from the environment — the system always boots in
deterministic mock mode and stays there until an operator configures a provider.
What lives here is ops config that legitimately belongs to the deployment:
guardrail thresholds, fan-out concurrency, retry policy, observability, and the
optional admin token that guards the control plane.
