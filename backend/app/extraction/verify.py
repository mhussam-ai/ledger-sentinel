"""The self-verify guardrail — the EXTRACTED → VERIFIED gate.

This is deterministic on purpose. The model proposes a transaction; this code
decides whether it is trustworthy enough to advance. Two guards:

  1. Confidence gate  — every field must clear `τ` (LEDGER_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD).
  2. Citation gate    — every record must carry an evidence trail; an uncited
                        claim is treated as ungrounded and quarantined.

Anything that fails is routed to QUARANTINE *with a reason*, never dropped and
never silently posted (ARCHITECTURE.md §8).
