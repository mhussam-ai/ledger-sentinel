"""AgentOps: the layer that turns autonomous behavior into something you can
inspect, score, and trust.

Every node in the pipeline emits a trace span carrying latency, token usage,
USD cost, the model used, and a *faithfulness* score. Faithfulness here is
computed deterministically (does the extracted value have backing evidence?) —
we do not ask another LLM to grade the first, because that just stacks
uncertainty. Spans stream to the dashboard's AgentOps tab and, if configured,
persist to Langfuse for historical dashboards and regression datasets.
