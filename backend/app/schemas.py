"""The canonical data contract.

Every source (receipt, bank CSV, UPI screenshot) is normalized to `Transaction`.
The reconciliation engine sees *only* this model — which is exactly what lets us
add a new source without touching the engine (ARCHITECTURE.md §5).

Two deliberate correctness choices:
  * `amount` is `Decimal`, never `float` — money is exact.
  * every record carries an `evidence` trail, so a QUARANTINE flag can always
    explain *why* it fired.
