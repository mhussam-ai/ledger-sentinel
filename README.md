# 🛡️ Ledger Sentinel

**An autonomous reconciliation engine that turns a messy pile of receipts, bank
statements, and UPI screenshots into one clean, trustworthy ledger — and refuses
to post a number it can't prove.**

_The LLM proposes; deterministic code disposes._

## The problem (one I live every month)

My spending is scattered across three card apps, a bank CSV, UPI screenshots, and
a wallet full of paper receipts. Reconciling them is genuinely awful: the same
coffee shows up in two places with two different amounts, a receipt gets
double-counted, and OCR quietly turns ₹450 into ₹480. The friction isn't
*reading* the documents — it's *trusting* the merged result.

Existing apps "categorize a screenshot." That's a script. The real problem needs
a **system** that can extract in parallel, **verify its own work**, cross-link
duplicates across sources, and quarantine anything it isn't sure about instead of
silently corrupting the ledger.

> Ledger Sentinel is that system. It is built around one principle:
> **the LLM proposes, deterministic code disposes.**

## Why this is more than a chatbot

| Capability | What it means |
|---|---|
| 🚀 **Parallel fan-out** | Every document gets its own extraction worker, run concurrently. 17 documents process in roughly the time of the slowest one. |
| 🔍 **Self-verification** | Each amount is extracted twice and must agree; low-confidence fields are routed to a quarantine lane, never auto-posted. |
| 🔗 **Cross-source reconciliation** | A matching agent links the bank line, the UPI screenshot, and the paper receipt for the *same* purchase, collapsing duplicates. |
| 🧩 **Schema-drift firewall** | Bank CSVs change columns without warning. A Pandera contract detects drift and quarantines bad rows instead of crashing. |
| 📊 **AgentOps built in** | Every reasoning step is traced, scored (faithfulness / confidence), timed, and costed — visible live on the dashboard. |
| 🎯 **Gated evals** | A labeled golden set scores quarantine precision/recall, extraction exactness, and link F1 on every run; the safety metric (quarantine recall) is a hard CI gate. |
| 🔌 **Pluggable model providers** | Choose **Anthropic, Google Gemini, OpenAI, or Mock** from the dashboard — paste a key, **fetch the models that key can actually use**, pick one from a dropdown, and the agent switches live with no restart. Default is always mock; nothing about the model stack is decided from the environment. One uniform provider contract; the pipeline never imports an SDK. |
| 🔁 **Durable runs** | Execution is decoupled from the live stream and backed by a replay buffer — a late, dropped, or proxy-blocked dashboard still gets the full picture (or polls the result). |
| 🛟 **Graceful degradation** | No API key? It runs in deterministic mock mode so the demo never dies on stage. Transient model errors retry with backoff, then degrade — the run always completes. |

## 🎯 Built for both tracks

This is **one submission for both the Engineer and the Tech Lead track** — the
architecture and the shipped, tested implementation are the same artifact. The
table maps what Damco said it looks for to where it lives in this repo.

| What Damco evaluates | Where it is in this project |
|---|---|
| **AgentOps & observability** — monitor agent behavior, evaluate outputs, guard against bad ones | Every node emits a traced span (latency · tokens · USD · faithfulness), streamed live to the AgentOps panel and optionally to Langfuse. A **gated eval scorecard** turns a quality regression into a red build. → [ARCHITECTURE §8](./ARCHITECTURE.md#8-failure-modes--hardening-agentops--guardrails) |
| **Cloud-native, not `localhost`** — a deployable system | One container serves API + dashboard; ships to a free **Hugging Face Space** in ~5 min, with the AWS production topology drawn out. → [DEPLOY.md](./DEPLOY.md) · [ARCHITECTURE §6](./ARCHITECTURE.md#6-scale-considerations) |
| **Reliable AI ↔ structured-data integration** | A **Pandera schema-drift firewall** quarantines (and self-heals) malformed bank CSVs instead of corrupting the ledger; one canonical Pydantic contract is the only thing the engine sees. → [ARCHITECTURE §5](./ARCHITECTURE.md#5-the-contract-canonical-data-model) |
| **"Think in systems, not tasks" · end-to-end ownership** | A LangGraph state machine where every transition is a *guard*, 8 named failure modes each with a coded guardrail, and a documented roadmap. → [ARCHITECTURE §3](./ARCHITECTURE.md#3-the-reconciliation-state-machine) |

### 📊 At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Principle** | The LLM proposes; deterministic code disposes — no number is POSTED unless it can be proven |
| **Stack** | FastAPI · LangGraph · Pandera · RapidFuzz · Pydantic · vanilla-JS dashboard (no build) |
| **Models** | Anthropic Claude · Google Gemini · OpenAI GPT · deterministic Mock — switchable live from the dashboard |
| **Tests / evals** | `45` passing · `5` gated eval metrics (safety gate = quarantine recall ≥ 1.0) |
| **Run anywhere** | Boots to mock mode: no API key, no network, deterministic every time |
| **Deploy** | One image, one origin → free Hugging Face Space (Render / Cloud Run ready) |

```

The orchestration is a **LangGraph state machine** —
`EXTRACTED → VERIFIED → MATCHED → (conflict → QUARANTINE) → POSTED` — which gives
us checkpointing, replay, and a free audit trail. Full design, diagrams, scale
math, and trade-offs live in **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## ⚡ Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhussam-ai/ledger-sentinel
cd ledger-sentinel

# One command, full stack — builds the SAME single-origin image the live demo
# runs (one FastAPI process serves the dashboard + the API). Boots to mock mode;
# pick provider + key + model live in the dashboard ⚙️ — no env, no keys.
docker compose up                              # → http://localhost:8000

# …or run it directly with Python (no build step, no separate UI server):
cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
```

- Landing page → http://localhost:8000  (the submission front door)
- Dashboard → http://localhost:8000/app.html  (or click **Launch the Dashboard**)
- API + interactive docs → http://localhost:8000/docs
- Sample pile to drag in → [`sample_data/`](./sample_data)
- **Deploy your own free live demo → [DEPLOY.md](./DEPLOY.md)** (Hugging Face Space)

```bash
# Prove correctness without a server — deterministic, no API key:
cd backend
pytest -q                      # unit + end-to-end + provider + eval gates (45 tests)
python -m evals.run            # the gated eval scorecard
python -m scripts.run_local    # offline terminal demo of the full pipeline
```

## 🎬 The 90-second "wow"

1. Drag the whole `sample_data/` pile onto the dashboard.
2. Watch the **agent grid** light up — every document extracting in parallel, confidence streaming in.
3. The **reconciliation canvas** draws links between the bank line and the receipt photo for the same coffee.
4. One entry pulses **amber**: *"Amount mismatch — receipt ₹450, statement ₹540. Quarantined."* The system caught a discrepancy a human would miss, and shows the evidence trail.
5. Open the **AgentOps tab**: traces, per-step latency, token cost, and a faithfulness score for every extraction.
6. (Optional) Mid-demo, drop in `bank_statement_drifted.csv` with a renamed column — the **schema-drift firewall** detects it, quarantines the rows, and self-heals the mapping live.
